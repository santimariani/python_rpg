# 100_Days_To_Victory

TECH: Python • Object Oriented Programming • Terminal • Git • GitHub

My very first project, <i>100 Days to Victory</i> is a text-based Role Playing Game that made me fall in love with coding. Already from the start, I found myself seeking to add pleasing, cinematic elements, yet also math and logic to create a fun user experience. In a special way, I enjoyed creating the fighting mechanics and enemy "Artificial Intelligence" that made the game come to life. Having created this from scratch, a spark was ignited within me — and a coding journey joyfully began!
